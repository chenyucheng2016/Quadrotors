# Quadrotors
This repo includes my implementations of two projects in Udacity Flying Car nanodegree program. One project uses PID controller to control the altitide, atttude and lateral motion of a quadrotor. The second project uses Kalman filter to estimate state of the quadrotor based on the observations and uses the estimated state to control it.
